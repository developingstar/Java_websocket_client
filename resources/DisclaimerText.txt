Publication is defined in the U.S. Copyright Act as the distribution or offer of distribution of a work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership or by rental, lease, or lending. Since some keyboards or fonts cannot reproduce the © symbol, the symbol (c) may be used instead, although the latter will not always be accepted as a substitute for the former. Use of the symbol “©” in combination with certain other requirements affords copyright protection in some foreign countries.
